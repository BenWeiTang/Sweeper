Sweeper is a revisit on the all-time classic Minesweeper. The aim is to max out game feel within the already well-know, yet somewhat static gameplay. I drew inspiration from the famous Tetris game Tetris Effect, hoping to do the same to see the classic in a new light.

The game can be downloaded at [my itch.io page](https://bentang.itch.io/sweeper). If you don't want to download the game but want to see the gameplay and the general feel of the game, you can find some gif at [my ArtStation page](https://ben_tang.artstation.com/projects/QnL9dB).

Highlight features include [manager class implementation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Core/Manager), [gameplay implementation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Core/Gameplay), [basic editor scripting](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Editor), and [experimental ScriptableObject-based animation system](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Animation).
